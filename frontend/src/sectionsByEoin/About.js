              Margaux’s French roots seen her raised with an appreciation of
              food culture, which followed her throughout her life as a simple
              pleasure. It was only later in life she decided to forge a career
              in her true passion, food. Having a great sensitivity to nature,
              and all living things, the core of her interest in food was
              leading the way in sustainable thinking and the betterment of our
              natural surroundings.
              <br />
              <br />
              Within Europe she gained an extensive knowledge in organic farming
              practices, working along side some amazing farming minds to
              develop her own growing style which she uses today. Wellbeing is
              also key to life, as she continually strives to increase her
              knowledge in medicinal plants and their uses. Together Rose and
              Margaux call upon their experience daily to help them achieve
              their goals as a leading sustainable food business.
